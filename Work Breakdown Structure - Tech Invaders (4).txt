Work Breakdown Structure – Tech Invaders (4)

1. ANALYSIS
• Gathering information at the MBP. (What are the problems they are actually facing?) & get to know how the current system works and propose how the current system can be improved,
• Man force.


2. DESIGN
• Using photo editing software to design the new system’s bin, which will track all information required.
o How will it look like?
o What colour will it be?
o Capacity.
o Safeplacetohidetheelectronics.

4. DOCUMENTATION
• Design circuits using sensors and Raspberry Pi to monitor each bin.

3. TRAINING
• At most a 5 day – 2 hours training will be sufficient to understand this system and know how to manage it.

5. TESTING
• Technical Documentation
o If ever the employees face any kind of
hardware or software related problem, they
can consult the tech doc. • User Documentation
o If ever the employees have forgotten how to use certain features of the system, they can consult the user doc.

6. MAINTENANCE
• Can release beta version of the circuit and software. • Maintenance will be done at MBP itself whenever needed.

7. EVALUATION
• Speed (current system v/s proposed system),
• Reliability (current system v/s proposed system), • Ease of use,
• Accuracy,
• Capacity,
• Attractiveness.

8. PRESENTATION
• Venue
• Audience
